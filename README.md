<b> Labour Share of GDP </b>

A typographic on labour share of GDP in 128 countries, indicating the disparity between labour and other economic activities in the country. 

This typograph is inspired by physical installations where information displays at a preset time interval. Labour Share of GDP is an indicator of Target 10.4 of SDG 10 Reducing Inequality; it focuses on adoption of policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieving greater equality. Through this visualization countriesâ€™ percentage of labour share can be identified.
